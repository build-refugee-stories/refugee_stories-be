Because I don't have the opportunity to teach, most of the time I feel angry, aggressive and nervous, having pressure because I can't do what I'm supposed to do. The women can't go out alone. I want to go out shopping or to the market or to the hospital and I feel like I'm in prison. I have to get permission to go anywhere.
