      story: 'She screamed a scream that made my heart ache. Then her body dropped dead in my hands. That is how I see Syria now. That\'s our country that we used to live in. It was a horrible night. The military aircraft was above us, we heard noises of explosive barrels and rockets that were falling everywhere around us. I took my kids and went to an agricultural land near the outskirts of the village to search for a place where I could guarantee safety for my little children. As soon as we sat under one of the olive trees an aircraft bombed the place with cluster bombs. My little daughter died and my children and I were injured.',

      story: 'Isaac\'s story - told by Steve his rugby league coach.\nIsaac was seven when I met him—a shy kid who didn\'t talk much. When I got him onto the football field, everything changed. He changed. He opened up and found his place. I started the Blacktown PCYC Spartans Rugby League team eight years ago. Hundreds of kids have passed through but some stand out. One of them is Isaac. Born in a Ugandan refugee camp, Isaac was only three when his family arrived here in Australia as refugees. His parents fled the civil war in South Sudan in the late 80s.\nHe knew he was different. His Dad recalls him asking \"why are we blacker than everyone else?\"\nHe confided in me that he was bullied at school and didn’t have many friends. Since joining the club, he knows most of the community.\nAt 14, Isaac is an amazing talent with a bright future. I can\'t help but grin when I talk about him. Seeing him blossom gives me so much joy. I love watching Isaac on the field. He excels, always giving 100 per cent.\nHe inspires confidence in his team mates, they play a lot better when he is on the field.\nIsaac\'s dream is to play rugby league professionally, and we all share that dream.',

      country: 'Thailand and Burma border', 
      story: 'I lived in constant fear as a child in Southern Burma. The only place I could escape the horror was in my parent\'s garden. Working on the land let me forget reality. The Burmese soldiers would come without warning. They tortured anyone caught running away. This is how I ended up spending 22 years of my life in the Mae La refugee camp on the Thai-Burmese border. Living in a camp is like being in prison. We were not allowed to leave or work. There was nothing to do. I thought I would go crazy. I came to Australia I knew that I should be happy but not speaking English made it difficult. I wanted to continue as a midwife but my English wasn’t good enough.\nWhen I heard that the rangers at Werribee Park needed help, I rounded up a few local Karen people to do weeding. We loved it. I felt that it could really make a difference to our lives.',

      country: 'Iraq', 
      story: 'In Syria I wasn\'t working. I was at home - a mother for the children. My husband was working as a labourer but if there\'s no work we had a garden to grow food and live on this. We opened the shop in the first year after we arrived. My husband\'s brother came here and gave me money and credit to open the shop. Three years later I\'m still waiting to pay them back [a debt of $400]. Most of the women are saying, \"Lucky you – you have our own shop\". But they are not seeing that I am tired from morning until midnight. I\'m only thinking about my children\'s future. The schools here are not good so that\'s the only thing I\'m scared of. Our hope is to go back to Syria tomorrow. Once we came to Kurdistan we thought that we would stay here for two to three months but it\'s now been three years.',

      country: 'Iraq', 
      story: 'Finding jobs here depends on whether you have friends or relatives to help you. I have 15 years\' experience in teaching but till now no employers have replied to me. I\'ve applied to all the NGOs, giving them my CV, but I\'ve seen that they\'ll take another person who doesn\'t have any experience or knowledge about the job. Because I don\'t have the opportunity to teach, most of the time I feel angry, aggressive and nervous, having pressure because I can\'t do what I\'m supposed to do. The women can\'t go out alone. I want to go out shopping or to the market or to the hospital and I feel like I\'m in prison. I have to get permission to go anywhere. The difference between living here and living in Syria is the difference between the sky and the earth. I can\'t tell you in words how different things are.',

She is 75 years old.\nAchan is a widow who had eight children. Seven of her children died during the ongoing war in her home country of South Sudan. As a result, she was left with many orphans to take care of. Before the war, she was a peasant farmer in Sudan who cultivated to sustain her big family. When the war broke out in her community, she and her family ran to save their lives, leaving all their belongings behind. She believes her home has been destroyed by the rebels.',

She shared her story through Gruppo Aleimar, an Italian NGO which provides free, nutritious meals to refugees in the Damour area. Alia is 7 years old.\n\"The last thing I remember of Syria, before we left, was when my mother was taking me from our place to our grandparents. The roads were full of dead corpses. I saw dead people with no heads or no hands or legs. I was so shocked I couldn\'t stop crying. To calm me down, my grandfather told me they were mean people, but I still prayed for them, because even if some considered them mean, they were still dead human beings. Back at home, I left a friend in Syria, her name was Rou\'a. I miss her a lot and I miss going to school with her. I used to play with her with my Atari, but I couldn\'t bring it with me. I also used to have pigeons, one of them had eggs, I would feed them and care for them. I\'m worried about them, I really pray someone is still caring for them. But here I have a small kitten that I really love! I miss my home a lot. I hope one day we\'ll be back and things will be just like before.\"',

Yara\'s story was shared with us by Concern Worldwide, which works with displaced persons inside Syria and with refugees and vulnerable host families in Lebanon and Turkey to meet basic needs, improve access to health care, and provide psychosocial support.\nYara has loved sewing since she was a child. \"My mother taught me when I was a young girl and said it would always be a useful skill,\" she said. \"I never imagined that one day it would come to mean so much, and provide me with a small income.\" Originally from Syria, Yara studied embroidery at a self-help group in Tripoli, Lebanon, run by Concern Worldwide\'s local partners. She attended workshops for two hours a day, and was able to leave her younger children at a partner-run kindergarten. \"Embroidery is a new skill for me,\" she said. \"There is so much to learn and every day we do something different. The main thing is that it occupies my mind and it stops me from thinking too much. Using my hands and creating something beautiful calms me. The lady who teaches the embroidery class is like a mother figure for us.\" Yara has been living in Lebanon with her five children and husband for the past two years. \"We were a close-knit family, but we had to flee Syria,\" she explained. Her parents and one of her sisters were a refugee camp in Jordan, and two sisters still in Syria. \"I worry about them every day\"',
